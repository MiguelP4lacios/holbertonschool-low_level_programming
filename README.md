## About the project.

**What is a low level programing language ?**
 
> A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture‚Äîcommands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language. Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture. ‚Äî [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language)

**What is C programing language ?**

C is a general purpose programming language originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1972 at Bell Laboratories, as an evolution of the previous B language, itself based on BCPL.

**Why C programing language ?**

C will give you a better understanding of how memory works and what is happening behind high mild languages like python or javascript.
